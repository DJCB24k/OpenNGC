- Name: Object name composed by catalog + number
    NGC: New General Catalogue

- Type: Object type
    We use object types listed in NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database
    See legend at http://ned.ipac.caltech.edu/help/faq5.html#5k
    (this will probably be changed soon, we must distinguish
    between Open Clusters and Globular Clusters and maybe simplify
    object types a little)
    We added type "Dup" for duplicated objects.
